ElePHPant is PHP mascot.

ElePHPant logo was originally introduced and created in 1998 for the PHP community by Vincent Pontier - spiritual father of
thousands elePHPants around the world. In 1998 there were mostly CGI scripts used for dynamic websites. A friend François BUFFIÈRE
introduced Vincent PHP language, which would according to him revolutionize the interactions with visitors on websites. Vincent
drawed PHP letters on paper and played with them a little. He noticed they come in the shape of an elephant.

In France at that time only few sites were talking about PHP. One was Jean-Pierre Dezelus' page and he was also a collector of elephants.
He asked Vincent to make an elephant logo for PHP with same style as the original PHP logo - a blue oval with a black outline gradient.

Than the original elePHPant logo came to birth:

The plush animal toy - elePHPant came to be 10 years after that.

ElePHPants are now present at many PHP conferences and programmers computers for inspiration and fun. Many PHP projects have also made variations
of the elePHPant with their logo on it.

Zend's Green elePHPant, PHP Women's purple elePHPant, PHP Architect's orange elePHPant. Also Laravel is on its way to make a red elePHPant as well
and the [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1560940280/laravel-elephpant) is progressing very well.
