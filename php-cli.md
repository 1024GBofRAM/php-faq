PHP is most known for writing web applications. But that is not the whole picture of PHP programming language.

You can use it to write CLI (Command Line Interface) applications or shell applications as well.

Some resources for PHP & CLI:

* [PHP CLI Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php)
* [PHP Shell Framework](https://github.com/piotrooo/php-shell-framework)
* [Symfony Console Component](http://symfony.com/components/Console)
