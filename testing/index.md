Testing code is important and should not be avoided although it adds extra time to development process of an application.
When you refactor your code, add new functionality or just make some minor changes you can quickly break something and
suddenly your application is not working anymore. The horror of every developer. That is why testing might help you deal
with this process and improve your development process.

In PHP there are many tools and frameworks available for testing purposes.

Testing approaches in PHP specific development:

* Test driven development
